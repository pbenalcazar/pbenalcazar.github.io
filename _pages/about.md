I am an Assistant Professor in the Division of Energy Economics at the [Mineral and Energy Economy Research Institute of the Polish Academy of Sciences](https://min-pan.krakow.pl/en/). I earned my Ph.D. in the discipline of Environmental Engineering, Mining and Energy from the [AGH University of Science and Technology](https://www.agh.edu.pl/en/university/).

Currently, my research is centered around the design, operation and modeling of power systems integrated with energy storage technologies. Additionally, I have a strong interest in mathematical modeling and forecasting within the field of Energy Economics.

If you have any questions or are interested in collaborating, please don't hesitate to reach out to me via [email](mailto:benalcazar@min-pan.krakow.pl).
