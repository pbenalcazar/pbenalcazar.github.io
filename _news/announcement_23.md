Iâ€™m happy to share that our paper where we assess the economic impacts that arise from the transition from net metering to net billing, evaluate the effect of the newly established net-billing scheme on the self-consumption of residential PV-only installations, and compare the impact of both compensation mechanisms on the profitability of residential PV-only and PV-battery systems has been accepted for publication in [Sustainable Energy Technologies and Assessments](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.seta.2024.104073).
