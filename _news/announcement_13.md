Our project, where we have created a GIS-based tool to evaluate the economic aspects of utility-scale photovoltaic systems, has been showcased in [pv magazine](https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/10/23/new-model-to-identify-land-eligibility-calculate-lcoe-for-utility-scale-pv/?utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter). The calculations were performed using the [Ares](https://www.cyfronet.pl/en/computers/18827,artykul,ares_supercomputer.html) supercomputer, which is located at the Academic Computer Centre Cyfronet AGH. Ares is renowned as one of the fastest high-performance computing (HPC) clusters in Poland.
