I'm excited to share that I've been recognized among the top 2% of scientists globally in the latest Stanford/[Elsevier](https://elsevier.digitalcommonsdata.com/datasets/btchxktzyw/7) rankings. This recognition is based on citations and research impact, and itâ€™s a reflection of my passion and commitment to Science and Energy Systems Modelling. **Thank you to everyone who has supported me along the way!**
